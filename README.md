## Thought process

I got a really good look at Assurant's main website and noticed a lot of forms and what seemed like externals apis. So I wanted to try and see if I noticed anything about their site that I can maybe do differently to show my thinking as a developer. 

I came across [this page](https://www.assurant.com/partner-with-us/consumer-goods/service-network-application). 

While overall not bad there were some things I thought could be changed. Mainly spacing. So I decided to try and whip something up based on what they were looking for. 

The things I used/implemented in this small project:

- Laravel
    - Blade
    - Dusk
    - Eloquent
    - Sail for Docker local development 
    - Artisan for model and resource controller
- Tailwind for CSS 
    - Flowbite for some CSS components
    - Mobile first design
- MySQL
    - Stores data submitted by form
